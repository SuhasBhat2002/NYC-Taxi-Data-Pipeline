# NYC-Taxi-Data-Pipeline
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline built with Mage AI and Docker. It extracts NYC Yellow Taxi data from a local file, applies transformations, and loads the processed data into Snowflake. The curated dataset is then connected to Power BI to build interactive reports and visualizations.
